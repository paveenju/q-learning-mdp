# Training Q-learning agent in an MDP environment
This work is based on this example from mathworks.com. Please enjoy attached python notebook in this repository to understand how to train Q-learning agent in a generic Markov Decision Process (MDP) environment.

To have better understanding in this work, I introduce sections as follows:
- [Reinforcement learning](#reinforcement-learning)
- [Q-learning](#q-learning)
- [Parameters](#parameters)
- [Results](#results)
